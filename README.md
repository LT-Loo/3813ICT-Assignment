# Chatroom

## Introduction
This is a chat system built with the implementation of Angular framework as the frontend, NodeJS as the server (backend) and Bootstrap framework for the interface design. This chat system allows users to communicate with each other in real-time within different groups and channels. Users are assigned with different permission roles when accessing the application.

## Git
### Git Layout
The git repository contains the source code of the project and a documentation written as a README file. The src folder contains all resources of the Angular frontend system while the server folder contains the source code for the NodeJS server system. All codes are modified and commited on the master (default) branch.

### Version Control Approach
Whenever a feature or section of work is completed, codes are staged and commited to the local repository and are then pushed into the remote repository (GitHub). To keep track on the working progress, short message is included in each commit to provide brief explanation of the feature for better understanding.

Since this is an individual project, I didn't find it necessary to create branches as merge conflict is unlikely to happen during the development.

## Data Structure
There are four main data structures designed for this application. They are User, Group, Channel and Member.

The User object stores the information of an user. It contains an ID, username, email, role and a date when the user is last active on the site. User objects are stored in an array.

The Group object stores the information of a group. It contains an ID, name and the date the group is created. The Group objects are stored in an array.

The Channel object stores the information of a channel within a group. It has an ID, name, group ID to tell which group the channel is belonged to and the date the channel is created. All Channel objects are stored in an array.

The Member object tells the channel a user has access to. It contains the ID, username and role of the user in the particular group, and also the channel ID and group ID. The Member objects are stored in an array.

A group can have a set of channels while a channel must belong to only one group. A user can be a member of multiple channels and groups.

The diagram attached below shows the relationship between the entities.

All data structures are stored on the server side in separate JSON files. These files are loaded on the server when the server program starts running. Data is collected as required and sent as a response to the frontend.

## Angular Architecture
## Components
### Login
This is the default route for the program. It consists of a login form with input fields for username and password, and a login button. When the login button is clicked, the program calls the login() function, which sends a HTTP POST request to "/login" route with the username in the server (Note that password authentication is not implemented at the moment). The server will check if the username received actually exists in the dummy data loaded from the JSON files. If the user is valid, the component will receive a response with user data which is then stored in the Local Storage. The application will then navigate the user to the Account route.

If the user is invalid, the application will receive a negative response. This will trigger the local error variable which then cause an error message to be shown on the frontend.

### Account
This is the route the application will navigate the user to after gaining permission to access the site. The route takes the user ID as the query parameter. 

Once the component is successfully rendered and loaded on the page, the application will first retrieve data from the Local Storage for later access. The page displayed on the frontend consists of a section to display some basic user information and also a section to list out the groups that the user has joined. Specific features or buttons are displayed based on the role of the current user.

The table below provides brief explanation of each option and the permission role a user should have to access them.

### Channel
This is the route that brings user to the channel room. This route takes two query arguments, the group ID and the channel ID. 

The component consists of three sections. A channel panel to list out the channels within the group which the user are given permission to access to, a chatting section to send message and communicate in the channel, and a member list to display all members in the group. There are extra features which are available only to users with specific roles.

## Modal
A modal is implemented as a popup dialog that allows several features such as creating a new user, adding a member to a channel etc. The modal is triggered by interacting with the buttons rendered in the Account page.

The table below provides description of the each feature shown in the modal and their respective functionalities.
